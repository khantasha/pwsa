This year, schools across the state pivoted like never before. They shifted to virtual learning, navigated and braved learning in a COVID environment, and now, a year later, are left to solve the learning chasms exacerbated by the pandemic – all in the midst of a transition in leadership at the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Acting Secretary <a href="https://www.education.pa.gov/Pages/Secretary-Biography.aspx" target="_blank">Noe Ortega</a> took reins of the Pennsylvania Department of Education in October 2020, in the thick of the pandemic when the country was seeing unprecedented levels of COVID cases and the first school year of virtual learning was underway. <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/Education-details.aspx?newsid=910#:~:text=Ortega%20will%20replace%20Pedro%20Rivera,all%20students%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Gov." target="_blank">Ortega was appointed by Gov. Tom Wolf</a> after former secretary Pedro Rivera departed his post to become president of Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology on Oct. 1. Leading up to his appointment, Ortega was the department’s deputy secretary and commissioner for the Office of Postsecondary and Higher Education.

Wolf said at the time that Ortega “has a proven record of advocating for equity and access for all students,” citing Ortega’s spearheading the state’s efforts to diversify its educator pipeline and to make classrooms more diverse; an ongoing disparity in local Pittsburgh schools.

With a new presidential administration, a new school year on the horizon, and a new leader, the Pennsylvania Department of Education is the captain for hundreds of school districts searching for guidance on how to educate in a coronavirus environment. 

PublicSource spoke with Ortega in March on topics ranging from the road ahead for Pennsylvania schools and how the department will address learning loss and exacerbated inequities to district funding needs and lessons he learned from this year to move the department forward in an unpredictable future.

**You took over the department in October and the pandemic was very much in full swing. Covid cases were still spiking and the first year with virtual learning was underway. So I'm wondering, you know, what was it like for you to take the mantle of this large organization amid a global pandemic? And are there lessons from your predecessor that you've brought with you into this role and kind of into this super unprecedented year?**

**How does the department plan to address the exacerbated disparities due to inequitable remote learning environments for students, and does the department have a plan to address these sort of persisting achievement gaps?** 

Students, especially those of color, have been impacted by the shift to virtual learning and data from the fall shows students falling behind in the new environment.

**You just got into so much. I think you started to talk a lot about specific ways that the department plans to address learning loss and remediate learning loss in the immediate future. Can you expand on that a little more, if there are specific plans you have around addressing learning loss?**

[VIDEO CLIP]

**When it comes to assessments, you’ve indicated that you want districts and charters to delay giving students exams until September. You basically said that it would be impossible within the next six weeks to balance the health concerns while safeguarding the validity of assessment results. Can you talk more about your perspective on testing in this covid environment and what you anticipate the future of testing will look like given this new environment?**



Ortega announced in late February that the department will allow public schools to postpone federally-required testing until the fall. While some states have held assessments for students, it looks completely different from years prior.

**Schools have been operating amid this pandemic and it uprooted normalcy for many Americans. I'm wondering what you think schools across the state have  gotten right this year?**

**You're not new to the Education Department. You've been there, but you're still relatively new to your position. So I'm wondering what you hope to accomplish in your two years and how your priorities and the department's priorities align with the Biden administration, or do they?**
